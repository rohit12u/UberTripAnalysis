# UberTripAnalysis
🚖 Uber Trip Data Analysis
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Uber ride data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The analysis uncovers key trends, patterns, and insights in Uber trip data, including peak hours, trip frequency, and location-based demand.

📊 Project Highlights
✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing

📅 Time-based analysis (hourly, daily, monthly trends)

🌍 Geographic analysis (popular pickup locations)

📈 Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn

🔍 Insights into rider behavior and demand patterns

🗃 Dataset
The dataset used typically contains the following columns (example):

Column	Description
Date/Time	Timestamp of the Uber ride
Lat	Latitude of pickup location
Lon	Longitude of pickup location
Base	Uber base code (dispatch base)

You can replace this with a real dataset source, like:
